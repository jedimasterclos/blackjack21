# Blackjack-21

## How to play


One of the most simple card games to play. The object of the game is to have the value of your hand reach 21 without going over. 



To start, the player is dealt two cards, face up. The number of the card is equal to its value unless it is a face card (Ace, Jack, Queen, King). The jack, queen, and king are worth 10 points. The ace is worth 11 points you only have one ace in your hand. If you have two or more aces in your hand, the ace will be worth 1 point. 


After the initial deal the player has the option to either hit (take one more card from the deck) or stand (leave the hand as is).

The round ends when the player is satisfied with their hand or their total is over 21. At this point it is the dealer's turn to try and get 21. The player is playing against the dealer, whoever gets closer to 21 without going over wins the round. 

In this game the dealer's cards are not shown, but the dealer will keep on hitting until he reaches a hand value of 17. The dealer will stand on 17 and above.
